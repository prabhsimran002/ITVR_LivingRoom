Twenty High quality HD 2048x2048 pixel PNG images in a "photo realistic" artistic style.

Seamless textures of rock and stone dungeon floors and walls that can repeated and tiled without any seams. 

Includes URP PBR materials and maps that can be imported via extra "URP Materials.unitypackage" with:
Albedo, Ambient Occlusion, Height, Normal, and Smoothness maps.

Includes HDRP Materials that can be imported via extra "HDRP Materials.unitypackage" with HDRP Mask Maps.

Can be used as a material to texture the walls and floors and other objects in a 3d game. Suitable for fantasy, historic, or modern games.

Can be used as sprites for tile-based games with seamless edges.

Art assets are created by a human with the assistance of software powered by Artificial Intelligence.

How to use?

By default the package includes materials created for the "Built-In Render Pipeline" which is the default Unity render pipeline for standard 2d or 3d projects.

If you want to use either the URP (Universal Render Pipleline) or HDRP (High Definition Render Pipeline) there are two seperate .unitypackage files that will import the proper materials for that render pipeline.

---------

Why do the materials have purple textures?

Typically this is caused by one of two issues:

1) Your project is setup to use a Rendering Pipeline that is different from the materials. IE the URP Materials only work with a URP Project, and the HDRP Materials only work with an HDRP Project. The Built-In materials only work with the standard built-in 2d/3d projects.

For more help with Render Pipelines see:
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/choose-a-render-pipeline.html

2) The images for the textures are no longer present for the material to load. The "Textures" folder should contain all of the image textures and maps including Albedo, Ambient Occlusion, Height, Normal, and Occlusion.
